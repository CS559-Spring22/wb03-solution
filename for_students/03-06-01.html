    <p>The first example implements the most basic QuadCopter (without advanced points) that flies in a circle. The code is
        easier to read and is enclosed by "Begin Simple Example Solution" and "End Simple Example Solution" comments.

    <p>The next example implements the following features with three QuadCopters:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The first one (best attempt to look like the Helicarrier from the Avengers) responds to mouse clicks. Each
            mouse click adds a person waving at the QuadCopter. While there are no mouse clicks, a random person could
            be added with a small probability.
        <li>The second one (best attempt to look like the Gunship from Avatar) responds to arrow keys and the WASD keys
            (QEZC also works).
        <li>The third one (plain QuadCopter with Red-Green-Blue colors) just flies in circles.</li>
    </ol>
